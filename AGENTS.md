- Keep atlas mock records in local JSON and access them through `src/lib/atlas.ts`, so a later data source can replace the mock without rewriting screens.
- Keep the atlas background and persona context in the root shell, so navigation preserves their state and visual continuity.

- Store short map relationship labels with each mock edge record, so in-graph summaries and evidence descriptions stay tied to the same data source.
- Keep atlas assistant model calls on the server and persist conversations under the signed-in user's account, so private history and credentials remain isolated.
- Store contributed research as owner-only submissions with private files and a pending-review status, so nothing enters the shared map without curation.
- Keep the chart assistant test mode client-only and explicitly labeled as sample answers, so it remains available without sign-in or model usage and cannot be mistaken for live research.
- Show OpenAI attribution only on the model-powered assistant, not the sample-answer test mode, so users can tell which experience calls a model.
- Keep the site-wide ambition separate from condition-specific scenarios, so an illustrative disease timeline is not presented as a universal outcome.
